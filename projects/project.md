# Project using NEMO and/or CMEMS data

List of themes and ideas for the project:

* Connectivity: Study the connectivity between different regions of the North Sea.
  + Discretise the North Sea in different cells
  + List a few points which work as attractor to particles within a small radius
* Age.
  + Residence time
  + Exposure time
* Beaching
  + Plastic transport in the North-western continental shelf
* Diffusion
  + Effect of diffusivity on particle transport
* Model intercomparison
  + Comparing the transport due to processes resolved by NEMO and CMEMS datasets
* Distribution
  + Particle transport analysis using meaningfull quantities
